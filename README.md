## Introduction

This repository provides implementations of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, and more. Each data structure includes:
- A brief description.
- Use cases and benefits.
- Code implementation in a selected programming language.
- Time and space complexities for common operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, you can either clone the repo to your local machine or download the zip file.

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/para-doxical/data-structures.git
cd data-structures
```

## Data Structures Covered

The following data structures are included in this repository:

1. **Arrays**
2. **Linked Lists**
   - Singly Linked List
   - Doubly Linked List
3. **Stacks**
4. **Queues**
5. **Trees**
   - Binary Trees
   - Binary Search Trees
   - AVL Trees
   - Red-Black Trees
6. **Graphs**
   - Adjacency List
   - Adjacency Matrix
7. **Hash Tables**
8. **Heaps**
9. **Tries**

Each data structure includes a separate folder with its own README file, code implementation, and sample usage.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
2. Clone the repository as shown in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.

## Usage

Navigate to any of the directories to explore the implementations. For example, to run the **Singly Linked List** implementation:

```bash
cd linked-lists/singly-linked-list
# Run the code (update based on language)
python singly_linked_list.py
```

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed for the programming language you're using. For example, if you're using Python, ensure you have the correct version installed.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
6. Open a Pull Request.

Please ensure that your code adheres to the style and structure of the existing implementations.
